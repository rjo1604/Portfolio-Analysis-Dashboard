# Portfolio Intelligence Dashboard üî¨

An interactive dashboard for thematic and AI-driven ESG analysis of stock portfolios. This project was built as a prototype to showcase modern data application development, creative problem-solving for data gaps, and the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) for decision support, inspired by the analytical tools used at leading financial firms like MSCI.

### ‚ú® Core Features

This application goes beyond simple data display to provide deep, actionable insights:

* **Dynamic Thematic Analysis:** Users can define their own investment themes (e.g., "AI", "Renewable Energy", "Cybersecurity") by entering custom keywords. The app then scrapes real-time news to score each stock's relevance to that theme.
* **AI-Powered ESG Proxy:** Solves the real-world problem of unavailable historical ESG data. The app uses the VADER sentiment analysis model to score news headlines from current and past years, creating a justifiable proxy for a company's ESG standing and tracking its "drift" over time.
* **Interactive Visualizations:** The portfolio is visualized through a series of Plotly charts, including:
    * A **2D Bubble Chart** mapping the entire portfolio landscape across Thematic and ESG scores.
    * Bar charts for deep-diving into individual stock performance.
* **AI-Generated Insights (Portfolio MRI):** After the quantitative analysis is complete, the user can generate a "Management & Risk Insights" report using the **Google Gemini API**. The LLM acts as a financial analyst, providing a narrative summary of the portfolio's key opportunities, unseen risks, and actionable next steps for further research.
* **Secure & Professional Backend:**
    * API keys are handled securely using Streamlit's built-in secrets management (`secrets.toml`) and are never exposed on the front end.
    * A professional dark theme is enforced for a modern, focused user experience.
    * All data fetching is cached to ensure a fast and responsive UI.
